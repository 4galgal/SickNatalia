<p> Here comes my motivational speech becauase as we all know I am doing a great job at 
supporting you so far.
<br>
Like seriously why do you still think my support will be of any use?!
Anyways I will try harder as our dearest friend has once told me.
<br>
Natalia for read you have to get better so we could meet up already and cry about life together
<br>
Plus I will finally give you your therapy session (I asked Siri how to spell that my brain definitely 
stops working at 00:00) , and trust me YOU NEED THERAPY, and I mean ASAP.
<br>
So as you can see my support is great as usual, and since it is in fact not your birthday 
yet I am not obliged to be all nice and emotional sooooo 
<br>
As a wise person once said:
 <q><i> You like a Dumb </i> </q> 
 <br>
 Love you so much and hope you will feel better, and look at me laughing at you for studying in Chrismas break
 when I have been working on it a whole day. 
 <br>
 I mean if that's not enough support for you I dont know what is THERE THERE...
 <br>
 Now my fav Tallaght besti (and close friend bla bla) I hope you'll feel better and keep missing me!!!
 <br>

 XOXO GOSSIP GIRL
